Note
The above Github link is provided with Pseudocode(Steps for code) for the assignments.

Problem statement: Convert a negative number to positive number
---------------------------------------------------------------
Pseudocode:
-----------
1. Initialize an integer with a negative number
   like, int number = -40;
2. Check if the number is a negative number 
   Hint : any number that is lesser than zero is a negative number
3. If so, convert the number to a positive numer

4. Print as below
        "The number -40 is converted to 40"


Problem statement: Check if the number is positive or negative
---------------------------------------------------------------
Pseudocode:
----------
 1. Initialize a number, say, int number= 35;
 2. If a number is positive, print "The number is positive"
    If a number is negative, print "The number is negative"
    If it nether negative nor positive, print as "The number is neither positive nor negative"

==========
Assignment #1: ( Class and Methods)
===========
--  Create a class "Calculator" with below methods
	(a) add(int num1, int num2, int num3), it should return sum of num1+num2+num3
	(b) sub(int num1, int num2), it should return subtraction of of num1-num2
	(c) mul(double num1, double num2), it should return product of num1 * num2
	(d) divide(float num1, float num2), it should return division of num1 / num2

-- Create another class as MyCalculator and call all the methods from Calculator and print the results
